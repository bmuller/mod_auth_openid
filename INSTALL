Basic Installation
==================

First, you'll need a few prerequisites.
 - libopkele from http://kin.klever.net/libopkele/
	It's a C++ implementation of important OpenID functions.

 - libdb_cxx from http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/db
	Berkeley DB C++ libs (now owned by Oracle)
		-- OR --
 - libsqlite from http://www.sqlite.org
	SQLite C libs

Next, run:
$> ./configure
or 
$> ./configure --help
to see additional options that can be specified.

Next, run:
$> make
$> su root
$> make install

Make sure that the file /tmp/mod_auth_openid.db is owned by the user running Apache.
You can do this by (assuming www-data is the user running apache):
$> su root
$> touch /tmp/mod_auth_openid.db
$> chown www-data /tmp/mod_auth_openid.db

Or you can specify an alternate location that the user running apache has write 
privieges on (see the docs for the AuthOpenIDDBLocation directive on the homepage).


Usage
==================

In either a Directory, Location, or File directive in httpd.conf, place the following directive:

AuthOpenIDEnabled        On

There are also additional, optional directives.  See the homepage for a list and docs.

The user's identity URL will be available in the REMOTE_USER cgi environment variable after 
authentication.

See http://www.butterfat.net/wiki/Projects/ModAuthOpenID for more information.
