Potential additions:
	- automatic purge if too many records in db (now every record has an expiration and is 
	  deleted when that expiration is reached - there should probably be some sort of failsafe,
	  though...)
	- http://openid.net/specs/openid-simple-registration-extension-1_0.html
	- granular user/group access control
