    Summary           : Session stealing
    Date              : May 2012
    Affected versions : all versions prior to mod_auth_openid-0.7
    ID                : mod_auth_openid-1201
    CVE reference     : CVE-2012-2760

# Details
Session ids are stored insecurely in /tmp/mod_auth_openid.db (default filename). The db is world readable and the session ids are stored unencrypted.

# Impact
If a user has access to the filesystem on the mod_auth_openid server, they can steal all of the current openid authenticated sessions

# Workarounds
A quick improvement of the situation is to chmod 0400 the DB file. Default location is /tmp/mod_auth_openid.db unless another location has been configured in AuthOpenIDDBLocation.

# Solution
Upgrade to mod_auth_openid-0.7 or later: http://findingscience.com/mod_auth_openid/releases
